							<p> Hi, I’m Deepa Tilwani; thanks for visiting my website! <br/><br/>

		
								<br/>
I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the Artificial Intelligence Institute, University of South Carolina, where I specialize in advancing Large Language Models, Artificial Intelligence, and Neurosymbolic AI. My research is at the intersection of AI and neuroscience, leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing, signal processing, and biosignal analysis to develop transformative solutions for complex neuroscience challenges.  

My work has been recognized with prestigious awards and featured in leading publications, reflecting its impact and innovation. With a strong foundation from my MTech in Computer Science at the LNM Institute of Information Technology—where I excelled in hackathons and competitive challenges—I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving to my field.  

Driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of AI and its applications in neuroscience, I am eager to connect, collaborate, and contribute to groundbreaking advancements in this exciting domain.
